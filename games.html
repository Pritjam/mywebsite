				<h4><a href="pages/pokefrogs.html">PokeFrogs</a></h4>
				<p>This is a simple text-based collection style game. You're a frog breeder, and you're trying to discover all of the different colors of frog that exist. The game implements a simple Mendelian genetics algorithm, as well as a lot of object-oriented design behind the scenes. I'm working on a full rewrite of the game now that I've taken a Data Structures class in Java, and I know a lot more about Java coding.</p>
