				<h4><a href="pokefrogs.html">PokeFrogs</a></h4>
				<p>This is a simple text-based collection style game. You're a frog breeder, and you're trying to discover all of the different
					colors of frog that exist. The game implements a simple Mendelian genetics algorithm, as well as a lot of object-oriented design behind the scenes. I'm working on a full rewrite of
					the game now that I've taken a Data Structures class in Java, and I know a lot more about Java coding.</p>

				<h4>PokeFrogs 2</h4>
				<p>My <a href="https://github.com/Pritjam/PokeFrogs-2">complete rewrite</a> of the game! PokeFrogs 2 will have lots of new features such as more frog characteristics, quests, and most
					importantly, an online component! The game will have online accounts that allow for cloud saving, trading, online marketplaces, and more. Stay tuned for details!</p>

				<h4><a href="pages/hexchess">HexChess</a></h4>
				<p>A small side project I've been working on that uses hexagons as the basis for a chess game, similar to the squares in traditional chess. </p>
