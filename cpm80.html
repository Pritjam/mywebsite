			<h2>The CP/M-80 Project</h2>
			<div class="thing">
				<h4>Conception</h4>
				<p>This project was mainly inspired by Charles Petzold's book, <em>CODE: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</em>. This book details the inner workings of computers, starting at the most basic level with switches and lightbulbs, and working up through boolean logic, gates, hexadecimal, and finally the Intel 8080 CPU. One of the things detailed in the book is a binary adder made from logic gates, to demonstrate a simple part of the 8080 CPU, the accumulator. I was inspired to replicate this adder on a slightly smaller scale in 6th grade. More recently, I was inspired to build a full computer around the 8080. </p>

				<h4>Resources</h4>
				<p>The most important resource I've had for this project is Grant Searle's page about his Z80-based CP/M build. My computer is a direct replica of his, found at <a href="http://searle.x10host.com/cpm/index.html" target="_blank">his page</a>. I'm also using his Atmega-based keyboard/display serial terminal, found <a href="http://searle.x10host.com/MonitorKeyboard/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Another huge help was the crew at the Team Ten discord server, who've been involved with many builds before such as the <a href="https://lkesteloot.github.io/alice/" target="_blank">Alice</a> computer and many other retro computing projects. They answered tons of questions about everything from part compatibility to build advice, and I couldn't have done this without them.</p>

				<h4>Version 1.0</h4>
				<p>the first version, just breadboards</p>

			<div class="thing">
				<h4>Beyond 1.0</h4>
				<p>Plans for a black polycarb casing, PCBs, custom software, and even a custom OS.</p>
