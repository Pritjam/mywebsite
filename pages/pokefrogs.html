            <p>The GitHub Repo for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/Pritjam/PokeFrogs">here</a>. The game is no longer in active development, but it was a fun project for the
                years I was working on it.</p>

            <h4>Conception</h4>
            <p>My biggest inspiration for this game is Pocket Frogs, a mobile game from 2010 focused on developing a collection of multicolored frogs. These frogs can be bred together to produce new
                color combinations and patterns. I was also inspired by the old-school classic text based adventure games like Zork and Adventureland. I started working on the game early on in my Java
                career, fresh out of AP CS in high school, so it was full of messy programming. Later on, I would go back and restructure the code using new concepts from my Java journey.</p>

            <h4>Development</h4>
            <p>I worked on the game whenever I had some free time in high school. At first it was completely local, but I eventually made a Git repo for it, partially to get some Git experience After
                getting the base game coded, I started work on a basic account system using Java Sockets, but quickly scrapped that, mainly due to inexperience with Java + Internet, and an interest in other projects.</p>
