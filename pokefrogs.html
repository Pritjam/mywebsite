            <h4>Conception</h4>
            <p>My biggest inspiration for this game is Pocket Frogs, a mobile game from 2010 focused on developing a collection of multicolored frogs. These frogs can be bred together to produce new
                color combinations and patterns. I was also inspired by the old-school classic text based adventure games like Zork and Adventureland. I started working on the game early on in my Java
                career, fresh out of AP CS in high school, so it was full of messy programming. Later on, I would go back and restructure the code using new concepts from my Java journey.</p>

            <h4>Development</h4>
            <p>I worked on the game whenever I had some free time in high school. At first it was completely local, but I eventually made a <a href="https://github.com/Pritjam/PokeFrogs">Git repo</a>
                for it. After getting the base game coded, I started work on a basic account system using sockets, but quickly scrapped that, mainly due to inexperience with Java + Internet.</a></p>
