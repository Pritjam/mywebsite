			<h4>Having fun!</h4>
			<p>I've gotten into a few different video games recently--the pandemic has definitely given me lots of free time! Recently, I've picked up Star Wars: Battlefront II, a third person shooter
				game set in the Star Wars universe. It's lots of fun to play with friends. I've also been playing a lot of Elite: Dangerous, the fourth installment in a long-running series of games
				where you play as a spaceship commander, flying your ship throughout the Milky Way galaxy, blowing up pirates and making tons of money.</p>
