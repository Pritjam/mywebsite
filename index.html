				<h4>Making this website</h4>
				<p>This is my first project with HTML/CSS, so it's really not much at all. I want to eventually add more features, like a guest book, hosting games I've made here, demoing projects I've been working on, and more! Currently, some of the links on the sidebar work.</p>

				<h4>Classes at UT Austin</h4>
				<p>I'm a CS freshman at UT Austin currently. It's tons of fun, and I'm learning lots about a subject I'm passionate about! Currently my favorite class has to be Computer Organization and Architecture (aka "arch") because it delves deep into the low-level side of CS, which has always interested me.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="thing">
				<h4>Having fun!</h4>
				<p>I've gotten into a few different video games recently--the pandemic has definitely given me lots of free time! Recently, I've picked up Star Wars: Battlefront II, a third person shooter game set in the Star Wars universe. It's lots of fun to play with friends. I've also been playing a lot of Elite: Dangerous, the fourth installment in a long-running series of games where you play as a spaceship commander, flying your ship throughout the Milky Way galaxy, blowing up pirates and making tons of money.
