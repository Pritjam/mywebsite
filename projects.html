				<div class="project">
					<h4>PokeFrogs</h4>
					<p>This is a simple text-based collection style game. You're a frog breeder, and you're trying to discover all of the different colors of frog that exist. The game implements a simple Mendelian genetics algorithm, as well as a lot of object-oriented design behind the scenes. I'm working on a full rewrite of the game now that I've taken a Data Structures class in Java, and I know a lot more about Java coding.</p>

				<div class="project">
					<h4>Binary Adder</h4>
					<p>In 6th grade, I built a 5-bit Binary Adder out of logic gates. This was inspired by Charles Petzold's book <em>CODE: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</em>. </p>

				<div class="project">
					<h4>CP/M-80 Computer</h4>
					<p><a href="cpm80.html">My build</a> of a Z80-based computer running CP/M and 4K BASIC. Heavily inspired by Grant Searle's build as well as Charles Petzold's CODE book.</p>
